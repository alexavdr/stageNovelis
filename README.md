In this repository you will find the exercises I did during my internship in Novelis from the 05/02/2024 to the 06/02/2024.

- **Exercise 1:** Returns the product of two given integers if the product is smaller than or equal to 1000. If the product is greater than 1000 it returns the sum of both integers.
- **Exercise 2:** Iterates through numbers 1 to 10 and prints the sum of the current number and previous number.
- **Exercise 3:** Returns the string "word" without the first n characters.
- **Exercise 4:** If the first and last item on the list are the same, it returns True. If they are different it returns False.
- **Exercise 5:** Iterates through a list of numbers. If the number modulo 5 is equal to 0, then the number is printed.
- **Exercise 6:** Iterates through each string in a list. If the string is equal to "Emma", variable "count" increases by 1.
- **Exercise 7:** Prints a number n followed by a space n times for numbers 1 to 5.
