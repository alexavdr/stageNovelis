### DAY 1
- **Exercise 1:** Returns the product of two given integers if the product is smaller than or equal to 1000, 
  if the product is greater than 1000 it returns the sum of both integers.
- **Exercise 2:** Iterates through numbers 1 to 10 and prints the sum of the current number and previous number.
- **Exercise 3:** Returns the string "word" without the first n characters.
- **Exercise 4:** If the first and last item on the list are the same, it returns True, if they are different it returns False.
- **Exercise 5:** Iterates through a list of numbers. If the number modulo 5 is equal to 0, then the number is printed.
- **Exercise 6:** Iterates through each string in a list. If the string is equal to "Emma", variable "count" increases by 1.
- **Exercise 7:** Prints a number n followed by a space n times for numbers 1 to 5.

### DAY 2

- **Lists:** creating functions from scratch (the union of two lists with and without repetitions as well as 
  the intersection of two lists)
- **palindrome**: creating a function capable of telling if a string is a palindrome
- **factorial**: creating a function capable of calculation the factorial of any given integer

### DAY 3
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Using the Hugging Face pipeline function for sentiment analysis
- **Transformers:** learning about transformers and how they work

###DAY 4:
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Exploring other aspects of the pipeline function
- **Scientific paper:** Beginning to write a scientific paper comparing the models BERT and GPT-3.5

###DAY 5: 
- **Scientific paper:** generating the dataset for the experiment and finalizing the paper
- **ChatGPT Prompt Engineering Course:** taking a course about prompt engineering on the platform Deep Learnin AI
